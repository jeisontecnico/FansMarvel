## Architecture
 This application uses the Mode-View-Presenter (popularly known as MVP) architecture. The philosophy behind
 this architecture is to enable separation of concerns and ultimately a very modular application. 
 
 This architecture was chosen because it provides the opportunity to separate concerns and implement
 "SOLID" principles which makes the application more robust and the code base scalable and maintainable.
 
 This due separation of moving parts makes the app more testable with unit tests.
